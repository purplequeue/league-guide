# Glossary

> This glossary is a living document. I will update it as I encounter new terms that I needed to search for the definition. This is by no means an exhaustive list. Feel free to add any term you might find relevant by opening a pull-request

**ACE** - When all the champions from the other team are dead at the same time. 

**Blue** - Blue buff on Summoner's Rift, from the Ancient Golem. Provides mana regeneration and reduced cooldowns for abilities.

**Bot** - bottom lane in Summoner's Rift or the champions who are laning there.

**Carry** - champions capable of dealing massive damage and taking down entire groups, but usually die themselves easily too (they "carry" the entire team for the damage). You might know them as "glass canons" from other games.

**CC** - Crowd Control, which refers to abilities that restrict a Champions ability to act or move, such as slows and stuns.

**CDR** - Cooldown Reduction. It has been replaced by [Ability Haste](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Ability_haste) for the in-game term, but some people still call it CDR.

**CS** - Creep Score - the count of the number of minions you've killed. Higher number means you've been better at last hitting, and have more gold to spend.

**Dive** - Tower diving, the fact of attacking an enemy under his tower, usually to deal a killing blow on a low-health champion. Doing so makes the tower attack the diver, making it a risky move.

**Gank** - To gang up on an enemy champion by surprise and kill them

**Leash (red/blue)** - helping the jungler with a neutral monster until the monster is at ~30-40% of health at the beginning of a game, so that the jungler can use Smite to finish it (usually people leave the area so that the jungler gets all the experience).

**Mid** - refers to mid-lane in Summoner's Rift

**Red** - Red buff on Summoner's Rift. It provides a buff to the attack, causing attacked enemies to burn for 3 seconds. When out of combat, it heals for 5 seconds.

**Top** - Top lane in Summoner's Rift or the champions who are laning there

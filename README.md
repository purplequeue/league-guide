# The Not At All Complete League of Legends Guide â€” Written by a total noob

So you have decided you want to play League of Legends, huh? Maybe a bunch of
your friends decided to play and you hopped on that train. And then you find
League quite fun and decides to understand how the game works a little better,
or how to play that cool champion that you just traded your blue essence for. So
you do what all of us do these days when we want to learn more about something:
we go to youtube and type "league of legends guide" on the search bar. And all
of a sudden you are hearing things like CS, Skill Shot, Minions and whatever
else these kids talk about and then you're as lost as a Lux in the Jungle.

So I wanted to write a guide which is actually a bunch of small guides of terms
and concepts from League of Legends. The content here is meant as a TL;DR for
concepts to help you get around. For more in-depth information you can always
refer to the [wiki].
